# Bubbles-App
The Bubbles App is a simple interactive application built using plain JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. It features four colorful circles, each with an associated arrow. When a circle is clicked, the arrow animates towards it and changes its color upon contact. Users can reset the application using a button, restoring the original state of the circles and arrows. This project showcases basic animation techniques and event handling in JavaScript.
